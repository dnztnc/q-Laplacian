## Welcome!

This repository showcases research on the q-Laplacian matrix of graphs by Matt Burnham, Steve Butler, Mitchell Johnson and Deniz Tanaci, mostly done at the Iowa State Math REU in summer 2025.

You can find a working draft, our poster for JMM, and our final presentation.

## Abstract

We study the eigenvalues of the q-Laplacian matrix of a graph G, defined as Lq(G) = qD(G)+A(G), where q is a fixed real number, A(G) is the adjacency matrix, and D(G) is the diagonal degree matrix. This generalizes the adjacency, Laplacian, and signless Laplacian matrices. We consider a shifted determinant that works nicely with forests and unicyclic graphs. In particular, for many q, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition on the eigenvalues for a graph to be a forest with a specific number of components. We also generalize the line-graph connection of the signless Laplacian and show how Lq behaves particularly well with Kn-decomposable graphs. In particular, we develop a method to construct pairs of graphs with the same eigenvalues (called cospectral mates) and apply it to construct cospectral mates of friendship graphs. Additionally, we prove that the graphs constructed by our method are the only cospectral mates of friendship graphs.
